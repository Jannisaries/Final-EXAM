Command design pattern was implemented by instituting a function that would count which pellets were eaten before which other ones
It would order these pellets into an array that they can be pulled out of. Each time pac-man eats a pellet, its designation will be squirrelled away into this array.

Next we would develop a spawn function that's similar to our regular spawning function. This one would, upon being given a request by the comand pattern, seek out
the pellet array and use it to respawn the last 7 pellets by pulling their order out of the array.

This would occur in a for loop. The designated pellets would then be reactivated at their locations in the game.

Now, for the command design pattern, we implement simple-ish series of classes and functions that will export a request to any given part of our code by whatever means it must
This pattern will take any request provided to it and act as deliverer of the message.
This message will be carried to whatever function it needs to be heard by and soon implemented by said function to accomodate the request.


The pattern works by loading command requests into an object without understanding as to what the request is. It's akin to men loading a catapult with ammunition.
They don't know where the stone will go, they just know a command came from on high.


It's use stems from its ability to seamlessly relay effective commands in the form of strings or objects. It can iterate requests at a much easier and simpler pace than any
other set of command functions could provide.
